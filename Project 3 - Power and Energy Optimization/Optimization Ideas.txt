Ideas for optimizations:
- Use a VLLS mode
	--> See powerpoint for all the necessary configuration steps
- Disable RTC clock
	--> According to Section 7.5, enabled in LL modes
- Optimize roll/pitch calculation to avoid doing trig functions and converting to degrees
- PWM the LEDs
- Interrupt from accel
- delay_Read_Accel occurs every interrupt...so we don't really need to run code to execute it
	--> Remove code
- ensure LEDs are only on for 10 ms
- Lower board frequency
